Install Docker Engine on Fedora


To get started with Docker Engine on Fedora, make sure you meet the prerequisites, then install Docker.

To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Fedora versions:

Fedora 30
Fedora 31
Fedora 32
Fedora 33

-----
Uninstall old versions
Older versions of Docker were called docker or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them, along with associated dependencies.

$ sudo dnf remove docker \
                  docker-client \
                  docker-client-latest \
                  docker-common \
                  docker-latest \
                  docker-latest-logrotate \
                  docker-logrotate \
                  docker-selinux \
                  docker-engine-selinux \
                  docker-engine

It’s OK if dnf reports that none of these packages are installed.
The contents of /var/lib/docker/, including images, containers, volumes, and networks, are preserved. The Docker Engine package is now called docker-ce.

-----

SET UP THE REPOSITORY
Install the dnf-plugins-core package (which provides the commands to manage your DNF repositories) and set up the stable repository.

$ sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core

$ sudo dnf config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo

Optional: Enable the nightly or test repositories.

!!!
These repositories are included in the docker.repo file above but are disabled by default. 
You can enable them alongside the stable repository. 
The following command enables the nightly repository.

$ sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled docker-ce-nightly
To enable the test channel, run the following command:

$ sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled docker-ce-test
You can disable the nightly or test repository by running the dnf config-manager command with the --set-disabled flag. To re-enable it, use the --set-enabled flag. The following command disables the nightly repository.

$ sudo dnf config-manager --set-disabled docker-ce-nightly
Learn about nightly and test channels.

-----

INSTALL DOCKER ENGINE
Install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next 
step to install a specific version:

$ sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
If prompted to accept the GPG key, verify that the fingerprint matches 060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35, and if so, accept it.


--------

Docker is installed but not started. The docker group is created, but no users are added to the group.

Cgroups Exception: For Fedora 31 and higher, you need to enable the backward compatibility for Cgroups.

$ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
After running the command, you must reboot for the changes to take effect.

$ reboot

--------

Start Docker.

$ sudo systemctl start docker
Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

$ sudo docker run hello-world
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. 
When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker Engine is installed and running. 
You need to use sudo to run Docker commands. 
Continue to Linux postinstall to allow non-privileged users to
 run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.
