security features

    The MCU has a built-in Tee security engine, and the code can distinguish between the secure world and the non-secure world.

    Integrated SASC/TIPC, memory and internal modules/interfaces can be configured with security attributes to prevent non-security code access

    Enable firmware signature mechanism to achieve secure Boot/upgrade

    Equipped with firmware encryption function to enhance code security

    Firmware encryption keys are distributed using an asymmetric algorithm to enhance key security

    Hardware encryption module: RC4, AES128, DES/3DES, SHA1/MD5, CRC32, 2048 RSA, true random number generator

low power mode

    3.3V single power supply

    Support work, sleep, standby, shutdown working modes

    Standby power consumption is less than 10uA
