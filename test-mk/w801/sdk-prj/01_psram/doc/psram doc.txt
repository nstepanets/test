4.4.3 PSRAM
W800 has a built-in PSRAM controller with SPI/QSPI interface,
 supports external PSRAM device access with a maximum capacity of 64Mb,
 and provides bus mode of PSRAM read, write and erase operations. 
The maximum read and write speed is 80MHz. 
When the storage capacity needs to be expanded, the off-chip PSRAM can be used to expand
Fill code storage space or data storage space. 
PSRAM also supports XIP execution of programs, and CPU Cache also supports cache
data in PSRAM.

25.1 Function overview
W800 has a built-in PSRAM controller with SPI/QSPI interface,
 supports external PSRAM device access, and provides bus-based PSRAM reading
Write and erase operations. The maximum read and write speed is 80MHz.

25.2 Main Features
= Support read and write access to external PSRAM
= Configurable as SPI and QSPI
= SPI/QSPI clock frequency can be configured
= Support BURST INC mode access
= Support half sleep mode of PSRAM

25.3 Functional Description
The full name of PSRAM is Pseudo static random access memory,
 which refers to pseudo-static random access memory. 
Compared with traditional SRAM
It has the advantages of small package, large capacity and low cost,
 and is mainly used for data caching in IoT applications. 
The interface is mostly SPI, QSPI . 
The interface pins mainly include clock signal SCK, chip select signal CS and 4 bidirectional data IOs. 
The PSRAM controller provided by the W800 can
It is accessed by the bus mode of PSRAM supporting SPI/QSPI interface,
 the maximum working clock rate is 80MHz, and the maximum capacity supports 64Mb.

25.3.1 Pin Description
SCLK: SPI interface clock, the SCLK cycle is set by PSRAM_CTRL[7:4],
 the minimum frequency division value that can be set is 3,
 and the default is AHB Divide by 4 of the clock.
CS: SPI interface chip select signal
SIO0: SPI mode data input, QSPI mode SD[0]
SIO1: SPI mode data output, QSPI mode SD[1]
SIO2: QSPI mode SD[2]
SIO3: QSPI mode SD[3]

25.3.2 Access Mode Settings
The PSRAM controller supports two access modes:
 SPI and four-wire QSPI to the external PSRAM, and the default is SPI. by setting
  PSRAM_CTRL[1] configures the mode of the SPI.
  PSRAM_CTRL[1] is 0 by default, that is, SPI mode.
 At this time, it takes 64 SCLK cycles to complete a write operation and
 64 SCLK cycles to complete a read operation. 72 SCLK cycles are required.

If PSRAM works in SPI mode,
 when writing 1 to PSRAM_CTRL[1], the controller will send command 35H to PSRAM,
When PSRAM_CTRL[1] is read as 1,
 it means that the command is sent and the PSRAM enters the QPI mode.
16 SCLK cycles, 22 SCLK cycles are required to complete a read operation.

If PSRAM works in QPI mode, when writing 0 to PSRAM_CTRL[1],
 the controller will send command F5H to PSRAM,
When PSRAM_CTRL[1] is read as 0, it indicates that the command transmission is completed,
 and the PSRAM enters the SPI mode.

The PSRAM working mode must be set after the initialization operation is completed,
 but cannot be set at the same time.

25.3.3 PSRAM initialization
 Before the first use, after the PSRAM is powered on and stabilized,
 write 1 to the register PSRAM_CTRL[0] to start the PSRAM reset initialization
 operation, that is, send 66H and 99H commands to PSRAM. 
By default, SPI mode is used to send, that is, 8 SCLK + tCPH + 8 time of SCLK. 
After initialization, the hardware automatically clears PSRAM_CTRL[0].
The initialization operation will restore the PSRAM to SPI mode.

The recommended initialization process is:
(1) Write PSRAM_CTRL[0] to 1
(2) Wait until PSRAM_CTRL[0] is automatically cleared
(3) Reset the PSRAM controller by soft reset
(4) Reset other required parameters of PSRAM_CTRL

25.3.4 Access Methods of PSRAM
The way of reading and writing to PSRAM is the same as that of ordinary SRAM,
 that is, writing/reading data to the corresponding bus address.

25.3.5 BURST function
By setting PSRAM_CTRL[2], the controller can support the BURST initiated by the AHB bus,
 that is, when the HBURST on the AHB bus is
At 1/3/5/7, it means that the AHB bus starts a continuous read/write with an address increment.
At this time, in order to improve the access speed of PSRAM, control the
After completing the read/write of a word, the processor will not pull CS high,
 but directly read/write the data of the next word.
The OVERTIMER register is used to set the maximum time for CS to be low,
 the unit is the number of cycles of HCLK, each time a BURST operation starts,
The internal counter starts counting from 0.
When the counter value is greater than the set value,
 the controller stops automatically after completing the read/write of the current word.
BURST operation, directly change CS to high level,
 if there is still data on the AHB bus to read/write at this time,
 it will be treated as a separate WORD
conduct.
The PSRAM controller does not support BURST in the form of WRAP. 
If WRAP BURST is used to access PSRAM, please
PSRAM_CTRL[2] is set to 0.
