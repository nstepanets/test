The function description in the w801 chip specification is too simple. Is there a detailed function description document?
I want to see the difference between HSPI and LSPI,,,

HSPI can only be used as a slave, with a maximum clock frequency of 50MHZ,
  which is slightly different from ordinary SPI usage.
LSPI can be used as a host, with a maximum clock frequency of 20MHZ,
   which is exactly the same as that of ordinary SPI.
