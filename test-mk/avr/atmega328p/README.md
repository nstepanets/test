The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P is a low power, CMOS 8-bit microcontrollers based on the
AVR® enhanced RISC architecture. By executing instructions in a single clock cycle, the devices achieve
CPU throughput approaching one million instructions per second (MIPS) per megahertz, allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption versus processing speed.
