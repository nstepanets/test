Raspberry Pi Pico

RP2040 is manufactured on a modern 40nm process node, delivering high performance,
low dynamic power consumption, and low leakage, with a variety of low-power modes to
support extended-duration operation on battery power.

Raspberry Pi Pico pairs RP2040 with 2MB of Flash memory, and a power supply chip
supporting input voltages from 1.8-5.5V. It provides 26 GPIO pins, three of which can
function as analogue inputs, on 0.1”-pitch through-hole pads with castellated edges.
