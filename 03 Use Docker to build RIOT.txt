Use Docker to build RIOT
Docker is a platform that allows packaging software into containers that 
can easily be run on any Linux that has Docker installed.

You can download a RIOT Docker container from the Docker Hub
 and then use that to build your project making use of all toolchains
 that we've preinstalled in the container.

Setup
Installing docker
To use the RIOT docker build image,
 the Docker application needs to be installed on your system. 
To install Docker, depending on your operating system, use sudo apt-get install docker or a variant.

The user on your computer requires permission to access and use docker.
 There are two ways to manage this:

Your OS distribution may create a group called docker.
 If so, then adding yourself to that group (and logging out and in again) should grant you permission.
Execute docker with sudo.
 This is in fact the most secure and recommended setup (see here, here, here and here).
 No extra setup steps are needed.
 make should be instructed to use sudo by setting DOCKER="sudo docker" in the command line.
Finally, download the pre-built RIOT Docker container:

$ docker pull riot/riotbuild
This will take a while. If it finishes correctly,
 you can then use the toolchains contained in the Docker container:
 (from the riot root):

$ docker run --rm -i -t -u $UID -v $(pwd):/data/riotbuild riot/riotbuild ./dist/tools/compile_test/compile_test.py
Usage
The RIOT build system provides support for using the Docker container
 to build RIOT projects, so you do not need to type the long docker command line every time:

(from the directory you would normally run make, e.g. examples/default)

$ make BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1
If your user does not have permissions to access the Docker daemon:

$ make BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1 DOCKER="sudo docker"
to always use Docker for building, set BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1 (and if necessary DOCKER="sudo docker")
 in the environment:

$ export BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1
running make without specifying BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1 will still use Docker
 (because of the environment variable)

Troubleshooting
On some Ubuntu versions a make with BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1
 can't resolve the host name of for example github.com.
To fix this add the file /etc/docker/daemon.json with the address of your DNS Server.

Using the native port with networking
If you compile RIOT for the native cpu and include the netdev_tap module,
 you can specify a network interface like this: PORT=tap0 make term

Setting up a tap network
There is a shell script in RIOT/dist/tools/tapsetup
 called tapsetup which you can use to create a network of tap interfaces.

USAGE

To create a bridge and two (or count at your option) tap interfaces:

sudo ./dist/tools/tapsetup/tapsetup [-c [<count>]]
